Introduction

Global trade is deeply influenced by geopolitical factors, making it a dynamic and often unpredictable sector. 
Our TideTrackers website gives historical insight into import and export trends based in Singapore and selected countries and for selected years.
We also provide a feature to predict the trade volume of different sectors with the country of choice for the near future years based on the historical political trends.

Our aim is to provide Trade analysts, such as supply chain managers, or fleet operations managers to anticipate imports and exports on a grand scale, given the political situation, as this is a volatile sector easily shaken by political disruption. jobs are at stake.

In this website, the primary factor we are exploring is Geopolitical Distance between countries, and how it affects trade volume. 
Geopolitical distance can be defined as a measure of geopolitical misalignment between countries, which could affect relations, and thus trade volume.
More specifically, we define "Geopolitical Distance" in this website as a weighted combination of:

1) Voting records in International Organisations
2) Tariffs imposed between countries
3) Free Trade Agreements between countries
4) Exchange rate of country's currency
5) Past GDP of country

This app helps you explore global trade trends and predict trade volumes based on Geopolitical Distance
