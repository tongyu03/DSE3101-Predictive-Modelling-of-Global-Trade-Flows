Introduction

Global trade is deeply influenced by geopolitical factors, making it a dynamic and often unpredictable sector. 
Our TideTrackers website gives historical insight into import and export trends based in Singapore and selected countries and for selected years.
We also provide a feature to predict the trade volume with the country of choice for the near future years based on the historical political trends.
Finally, we have a map which shows the trading port in different cities to help trade operators know which ports are available in their country of choice

Our aim is to provide Trade analysts, such as supply chain managers, or fleet operations managers to anticipate imports and exports on a grand scale, given the political situation, as this is a volatile sector easily shaken by political disruption. jobs are at stake. 

This app helps you explore global trade trends, predict trade volumes, and analyze port locations.
